          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            Art has always been an important aspect of my life since I was a child. It was my favourite subject throughout school, and it is still my favourite thing to do now.
            Drawing has gotten me through those boring classes and made my notebooks look 10x better than they would have if they were just plain notes. Don't worry, art never
            hindered my grades, and if anything it brought them up! Jokes aside, I graduated and that's what matters, right?  .... NOOO.
          </p>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            I went through a quarter life crisis and I was in a really dark place. I was in a program I didn't like, but at the same time I didn't know what else to go into.
            (If you're wondering "why not art?", I'll be getting to that soon!)  I took a half semester off in hopes to pull my life together, but to no avail.
          </p>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            I felt trapped, lost, confused, and absolutely worthless.  I hit rock bottom and felt like giving up so many times. Even though I had my brother and a
            few friends who I could talk too, I still just felt like they wouldn't care, and that I was a bother to them. So I just kept these feelings
            bottled up inside me– for a good 1-2 years.
          </p>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            Long story short, it was art that helped me cope. Art was the big factor that helped me overcome that dark moment in my life and helped me express how I was feeling
            in ways that words just couldn't
          </p>


          <!-- WHY I WANT AN APPRENTICESHIP  -->
          <h5 id="apprenticeship" class="text-gold pt-5">WHY I WANT AN APPRENTICESHIP </h5>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            Originally, art was what I wanted to study, but as an asian child that would have been a disgrace. Let alone tattoos– they were viewed as  "taboo" in my household.
            However, now that I've matured, I say f*ck it! I'm tired of living in fear of what my parents and others think about an art career. It's my life, and I want to live it doing
            what I love. Reflecting on it now, I realize that the ONE thing that I've always loved, and the ONE thing that I was always fairly decent at, was Art.
          </p>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            Art has always made sense to me, and even though I didn't realize it during my low point, art was there to help me overcome it and grow as an individual. (I still
            have the pieces  that helped me stay strong. However, I don't believe they're the greatest! Always down to show 'em to those who are interested!)  The
            time for change is the present, and if I can make a living with drawing, then I'm going for it! For these reasons, I am looking for a tattoo apprenticeship.
          </p>


          <!-- MY ART STYLE  -->
          <h5 id="my-art-style" class="text-gold pt-5">MY ART STYLE</h5>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            So if it wasn't already obvious, I have always loved art. Especially tattoos because it uses the skin as the canvas. Additionally, I love how the art "attaches" to
            the person, for a REALLY long time. My favourite tattoo styles are Black and Grey Realism,  Illustrative, Asian, and Fineline/Micro tattoos.
          </p>
          <p class="light-paragraph sm-text">
            My favourite styles to draw are realism, and illustrative. Although I do love challenging myself by drawing things outside my comfort zone! Recently I have been into
            creating <a href="illustrative.html">linework designs</a> that combine aspects of realism, illustration, and geometric.  My particular style uses black & grey, with occasional hints of red. Additionally,
            smooth shading and clean edges are what help bring my art to life. Although my drawings tend to be on the small side, I always strive to ensure they have depth and detail.
